The Sloth Engine is a 2D video game engine that I'm currently building. I enjoyed using Unity, so I thought I would deepen my understanding of what goes into an engine by creating my own that I can then use to create any 2D game I would like. 

It will have full Entitys to be able to manipulate in the scene how ever you want with transforms, sprites, hitboxes, etc. Anything you would need in a 2D game engine.

It even has fully dockable windows for easy work space manipulation
